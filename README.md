## Relay Controller

Do you have a relay connected to the GPIO pins of your Raspberry Pi? If so, then this application is for you. Simply run the executable and open your browser to control the relay using the intuitive web interface.

### Behind the Scenes

Relay Controller consists of two components:

- the backend server providing the API written in Go
- the front-end web interface written in JavaScript using Ember
